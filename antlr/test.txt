31.  What do Mio's breath sounds indicate?
     A.    1, 2, 3
	B.    \*1, 3, 5
	C.    1, 5, 6
	D.    1, 4, 5

32.  Mio has an arterial blood gas drawn at the same time the assessment is completed.  You anticipate the ABG will show: 
A.   low pO2 due to deadspace V/Q mismatch, evidenced by fine crackles throughout all 
                 lung fields.
B.   low pO2 due to decreased compliance and increased work of breathing
C.   pO2 normal or slightly elevated due to rapid respiratory rate, which increased 
                 ventilation and gas exchange
D.   low pO2 due to shunt V/Q mismatch, evidenced by fine crackles throughout all 
                 lung fields

33.  You anticipate that the ABG will show that Mio’s pCO2 is:
A.   \*unchanged, or slightly low, because she is breathing rapidly
B.   low, because she is experiencing a shunt V/Q mismatch
C.   high, because she has a gas exchange problem evidenced by rapid respiratory rate, 
              increased work of breathing, and decreased compliance.
D.   high, because she is experiencing deadspace V/Q mismatch

34.  Mio’s assessment findings show low urine output over several hours (90 ml dark amber urine in 6 hours).  This indicates that:
A.  her renal oxygen supply and demand are balanced as she is producing urine
B.  she is hypovolemic and requires fluids
C.  there is decreased oxygen supply to the kidneys due to decreased afterload
D.  \*there is decreased oxygen supply to the kidneys due to poor perfusion

35.   Assessment findings that indicate the gastrointestinal system is not receiving enough oxygen supply relative to its oxygen demand include:
A.   nausea, hyperactive bowel sounds, and diarrhea
B.   hypoactive bowel sounds, nausea, hyperresonance of the intestine
C.   \*nausea, hypoactive bowel sounds, loss of appetite
D.   absent bowel sounds, distention, constipation
